# KellyBet
A simple attempt at implementing the ideas found in a math paper by Edward O. Thorp via Python to optimize bankroll growth over high volume sports betting. Moneyline odds are scraped with selenium from FanDuel and associated team win probabilities are scraped from numberFire. Ideally, the goal is to develop an independent model for estimating a given team's win probability based on a number of statistically relevant values in a given sport, and use those to calculate what the optimized fraction of your bankroll should be wagered on a team given the sportsbook's moneyline quote. Quotes from multiple sportsbooks will also be used in order to "shop" for the best price, making wagers more efficient and allowing for a higher volume of bets per day. The optimized fraction to bet is calculated based on the Kelly Criterion, as discussed in E.O. Thorpe's paper "The Kelly Criterion in Blackjack Sports Betting, and the Stock Market" 1997.
